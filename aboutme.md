### My story

My name is Tim Muaj Vue, I'm a developer with a passion for game and app design.

I've spent the majority of my adolescence playing games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends and Realm of the Mad God (not Runescape though sorry.) I would consider myself to be a Hard-core gamer as I've ranked among the top 5% of all players in the world on World of Warcraft. Like most gamers I always thought that it would be so cool to be a developer and make a game that I could share with others, I suppose that was the reason I decided to start programming.

The goal of this website is to document and diary my progress and projects as a Developer! Though I've only started this journey I look forward to what I can and will do in the upcoming future!
