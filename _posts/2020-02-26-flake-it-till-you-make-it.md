My goal with this project is to familiarize myself with Unitys environment and see how it feels like to develop and design a game from scratch. Im particularly interested rogue-likes and with my limited knowledge and resources I decided to make a 16-bit game with rogue-like systems, although I haven't fully decided on what kind of combat or environment this game would take place in. This is my very first Dev Diary.
